In particular, we make data accessible, interoperable and reusable by packaging data and descriptive metadata in dtool datasets. The dtool lookup server makes data on a group-wide S3 object storage repository findable. The dtool ecosystem has proven applicable both for manual research data management as well as rapid generation of thousands of datasets in automized workflows.},

  abstract = {The Cluster of Excellence Living, Adaptive and Energy-autonomous Materials Systems (livMatS) develops novel, bioinspired materials systems that adapt autonomously to their environment and harvest clean energy from it. For sustainable progress with this mission, making research data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable- FAIR - is essential. livMatS` research data management (RDM) concept builds upon the three RDM pillars of advocacy, support, and technical infrastructure. Advocacy means the promotion of RDM best practices with workshops, talks, and direct exchange. Support means helping affiliates with data management-related questions, in particular in creating solid data management plans. On the technical level, this involves the identification of suitable RDM services, platforms and tools. With disciplines like energy research, biomimetics, microsystems engineering, sustainability research, psychology and philosophy involved in livMatS, there cannot be a one-fits-all software solution. Instead, livMatS must keep close track of available external services and filter them based on their future perspective. Within the realm of chemistry, for example, the electronic lab notebook chemotion together with the chemotion repository is evolving towards a FAIR standard service ecosystem and was thus incorporated within the livMatS RDM concept. Next to the observation of and referral to such reliable (discipline-specific) external platforms, livMatS decided to promote a low-treshold decentralized data management ecosystem, dtool, and offer a livMatS-wide data repository based on bwSFS, the Baden-W{\"u}rttemberg- and DFG-funded S3 object Storage for Science. The intended purpose here is twofold: Firstly, livMatS offers an independent fallback service to go FAIR for any willing affiliate not provided with RDM guidance elsewhere. Secondly, dtool encourages the use of machine-readable metadata formats for data documentation and allows offering fillable templates adhering to specific schema, but does not enforce either. Eventually, the decision on how far to go in terms of FAIRness lies with each user and their choice of documentation standards. Hence, dtool and the livMatS data repository provide a didactic bridge between the status quo of completely standard-free data management at the individual level at one end and fully FAIR platform solutions with rigid metadata documentation requirements at the other end. Here, we introduce the advocacy, support, and technical infrastructure pillars of the livMatS RDM concept with a focus on dtool and its didactic use within workshops and hands-on sessions.},

  abstract = {We use molecular dynamics simulations to study the frictional response of monolayers of the anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate and hemicylindrical aggregates physisorbed on gold. Our simulations of a sliding spherical asperity reveal the following two friction regimes: at low loads, the films show Amonton's friction with a friction force that rises linearly with normal load, and at high loads, the friction force is independent of the load as long as no direct solid--solid contact occurs. The transition between these two regimes happens when a single molecular layer is confined in the gap between the sliding bodies. The friction force at high loads on a monolayer rises monotonically with film density and drops slightly with the transition to hemicylindrical aggregates. This monotonous increase of friction force is compatible with a traditional plowing model of sliding friction. At low loads, the friction coefficient reaches a minimum at the intermediate surface concentrations. We attribute this behavior to a competition between adhesive forces, repulsion of the compressed film, and the onset of plowing.},

  abstract = {Making data FAIR---findable, accessible, interoperable, reproducible---has become the recurring theme behind many research data management efforts. dtool is a lightweight data management tool that packages metadata with immutable data to promote accessibility, interoperability, and reproducibility. Each dataset is self-contained and does not require metadata to be stored in a centralised system. This decentralised approach means that finding datasets can be difficult. dtool's lookup server, short dserver, as defined by a REST API, makes dtool datasets findable, hence rendering the dtool ecosystem fit for a FAIR data management world. Its simplicity, modularity, accessibility and standardisation via API distinguish dtool and dserver from other solutions and enable it to serve as a common denominator for cross-disciplinary research data management. The dtool ecosystem bridges the gap between standardisation-free data management by individuals and FAIR platform solutions with rigid metadata requirements.},

  abstract = {We study the frictional response of water-lubricated gold electrodes subject to an electrostatic potential difference using molecular dynamics simulations. Contrary to previous studies on electrotunable lubrication that were carried out by fixing the charges, our simulations keep electrodes at fixed electrostatic potential using a variable charge method. For pure water and NaCl solutions, viscosity is independent of the polarization of the electrodes, but wall slip depends on the potential difference. Our findings are in agreement with previous analytical theories of how wall slip is affected by interatomic interactions. The simulations shed light on the role of electrode polarization for wall slip and illustrate a mechanism for controlling friction and nanoscale flow in simple aqueous lubricants.},
