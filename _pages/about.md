Experienced research professional specializing in computational modeling for micro- and nanotribology and materials science. Key achievements include:

- Established continuum models of rough interfaces using FEM to study solvent concentration variations on rough surfaces.
- Developed atomistic models of surfactant adsorption films using MD for Ph.D. research.
- Applied machine learning (GPC, GPR) to predict rough surface performance in an entrepreneurial venture.
- Co-coordinated proposal writing for the DFG-funded 'AWEARNESS' project, employing DFT to study zinc phosphate glasses typically grown as films in tribo-induced decomposition reactions of ZDDP, a common additive in engine oils.
- All these modeling contributions have been made possible by rigid design of reproducible workflows with well-established Workflow Management Systems (WMS).
- Co-developer and maintainer for the [dtool & dserver](www.dtool.dev) data management ecosystem, a community effort.

Currently serving as Data Steward at the Cluster of Excellence [livMatS](https://www.livmats.uni-freiburg.de).
